# Flomm player - personal audio player

## Introduction

This webapp aims to mimic well-known audio players.
It has several features, including custom scrollbar and buttons for handling the audio, shuffle option, editable tracklists, backed up with a PostgreSQL database and global hotkeys to control the player.

The application is written in Typescript and vanilla Javascript.
For reading the mp3 tags, I used the following library:
`JS MediaTags` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsmediatags

### Global hotkeys

- `SPACE` toggles play / pause
- `N` plays the next track
- `P` plays the previous track
- `ESC` mutes the volume
